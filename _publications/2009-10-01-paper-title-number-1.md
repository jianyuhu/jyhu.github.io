excerpt: 'This work is concerned with the dynamics of a class of slow–fast stochastic dynamical systems driven by non-Gaussian stable Lévy noise with a scale parameter. Slow manifolds with exponentially tracking property are constructed, and then we eliminate the fast variables to reduce the dimensions of these stochastic dynamical systems. It is shown that as the scale parameter tends to zero, the slow manifolds converge to critical manifolds in distribution, which helps to investigate long time dynamics. The approximations of slow manifolds with error estimate in distribution are also established. Furthermore, we corroborate these results by three examples from biological sciences.'
