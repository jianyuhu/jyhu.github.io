My research interests are in stochatic dynamical systems, probability and their applications in scientific computing. My current research focuses on learning dynamics from data. I am interested in the following topics:

* Interaction of geometry, stochasticity and machine learning
* Learning theory of kernel method and deep learning
* Dynamics for stochastic dynamical systems
