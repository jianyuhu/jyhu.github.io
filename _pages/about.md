My research interests are in stochatic dynamical systems, probability and their applications in scientific computing. My current research focuses on learning dynamics from data. I am interested in the following topics:

* Statistics and machine learning, learning theory
* Inverse problems, regularization
* Dynamics for stochastic dynamical systems
* Malliavin calculus, Stein's method, and stochastic PDEs
